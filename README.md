## Working with this repository

If you're merely using vvvv, this repository is not for you. It is only useful for developers who want to fix/improve/add-to libraries that are part of this repository.

The individual libraries are organized in directories. Each directory starting with "VL." holds the sources of one library. 

Working with this repository requires two steps:
- Build `VL.StandardLibs.sln` using Visual Studio 2022
- Run vvvv with this directory as a [source package-repository](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/extending/contributing.html)
