# The VL.StandardLibs contributing guide

Before getting to work, please start a discussion around your proposed changes in an issue, to:
* Make sure that no one else is working on that same topic already
* Lay out your plans and discuss them with others to make sure your idea is properly architectured and would fit well with the project
