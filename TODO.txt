Public repo TODOS:

- Ensure ffmpeg.exe and msdfgen.exe are in final build output (coming from Stride.Assets, use GenPathProperty and copy them)
- See to it that Stride.Tests are running
- System.IO.Ports is referenced by vvvv.exe - this is not correct, we need to re-write the type forward lookup, it needs to be done whenever the set of referenced assemblies changes
