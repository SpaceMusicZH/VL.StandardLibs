    /// A ChannelHub manages the lifetime of channels.
    /// 
    /// Channels & Bindings:
    /// The user shall be able to edit global channels manually in an editor extension window.
    /// It shall be possible to remove channels, even if some come with a couple of bindings. Those should get deleted as well.
    ///     Bindings could get stored as components attached to a channel.
    ///     A Redis app component would only store which channels to sync (their names e.g. via a regular expression query and look 
    ///     up the Redis bindings in the found channels in the ChannelHub).
    /// 
    /// Entry points:
    /// A user wants to think per entry point. 
    /// Reasoning: 
    ///     Opening help patches shall not mess up your project entry point; 
    ///     After closing a patch the dev session should be as clean as possible..
    /// Per entry point we have one channel hub that represents all global channels for the app. 
    /// There still could be a way to opt-into a global channel behavior that binds channels of different entry points:
    ///     a certain app component that bridges one entry-point with the other (merges their ChannelHubs on localhost).
    /// 
    /// IDE & imperative API:
    /// Editor extension windows (for editing global channels and their bindings) show the global channels
    /// for one entry point - which could be synced to what patch we currently look at. There could be different
    /// such windows that all want to help the user from different angels (MIDI specific view, overview over 
    /// all channels and their bindings...). 
    ///     In order to implement those windows the channel hub has an imperative way to add and remove or modify channels. 
    /// 
    /// Descriptive API:
    /// An alternative design is to have channel description providers, which can register and tell of their needs via
    /// something like a IObservable<IEnumerable<ChannelDescription>>. The distinct, merged needs of all channel 
    /// providers would determine which channels exist. This could be added later. 
    ///     All those channels could be locked; they wouldn't be editable by the user, since those are needed by some app component.
    ///     When adding an IOBoxSyncAppComponent this could be thought of as a collection of channeldescriptions, resulting in locked channels
    /// 
    /// vvvv Editor ChannelHub:
    /// The vvvv editor runtime can be seen as yet another app, which comes with its own channels hub.
    /// A boygroup app component e.g. would be part of the vvvv IDE, which shall work even when in paused or stopped mode.
    /// Such a boygrouping app component would setup a Redis binding for some central channels inside the editor channel hub.
    ///     A channel Boygrouping/DocDiffs is not visible to the user as it is part of the IDE channelhub, not an entry-point channelhub.
    /// 
    /// Usage & Storage:
    /// For the user app the user shall place a GlobalChannels node somewhere. 
    /// That's the place where to store the channel descriptions in a pin. 
    /// This way we don't need to invent config files or hidden areas in a vl document to store those settings. 
    /// The user is boss where to place this central node and how to reference the file in question.
    /// Ideally the patcher would only get access to the global channels when there is a reference to the document that 
    /// has setup those channels. 
    /// 
    /// Accessing channels:
    /// Access to channels can be granted by statically typed nodes - named after the channel - and by dynamic lookups.
    /// Whenever the ChannelHub for an entry point changed its entries new nodes get built by a factory accordingly. 
    /// BeginChange can be used to group changes in bulks, so that the event OnChannelsChanged triggers less often.
    /// The ChannelHub implementation takes care of creating the nodes.
    /// 
    /// Implementation:
    /// The GlobalChannels node would aquire the IChannelHub app component per app via IAppHost.GetComponent;
    /// And then take control over it, representing the single source of truth for the channels for this app.
    /// App Components (e.g. Redis) are managed by the apphost. It disposes all app components on Stop.
    /// They can and should make use of this moment and leave a clean state. E.g. remove certain channels from a Redis database.
